# Clickbait-Detection-Project

## Project Overview

The Clickbait Detection project aimed to develop a machine-learning model capable of accurately classifying headlines as either clickbait or non-clickbait. Clickbait headlines are designed to attract attention and entice users to click, often using sensationalist language. Detecting such headlines is crucial for improving the quality of content and user experience on online platforms.

## Project Background

Online platforms often struggle with the proliferation of clickbait headlines, which can degrade user experience and trust. This project addressed this issue by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and filter out clickbait content. The primary objective was to build a robust model that could discern clickbait from genuine headlines with high accuracy.

## Approach 
Given the complexity of NLP tasks, I chose to use a transformer-based model, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT's ability to understand the context of words in a sentence made it an ideal choice for this classification task. The dataset consisted of headlines and their corresponding labels (clickbait or non-clickbait), extracted from various online sources. The project involved several key steps:

 1. __Data Preparation:__ Preprocessing the text data by tokenizing the headlines using BERT's tokenizer.

 2. __Model Selection:__ Initializing the BERT model for sequence classification with two labels (clickbait and non-clickbait).

 3. __Training:__ Training the model over 50 epochs, using the AdamW optimizer and a PyTorch DataLoader for efficient batch processing.

 4. __Evaluation:__ Evaluating the model's performance using the F1 score, a metric that balances precision and recall.

## AI Methods Applied During this project

 * __Data Preparation:__ The dataset required careful preprocessing to ensure compatibility with BERT. This involved tokenizing the headlines, padding them to ensure uniform input size, and creating attention masks. 

 * __Model Architecture:__ I used BERT for sequence classification, fine-tuning the pre-trained model on our specific task. This approach leveraged BERT's deep understanding of language context.

 * __Training and Optimization:__ The model was trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 16. Training was conducted on a GPU to handle the computational load.

 * __Evaluation Metrics:__ The F1 score was chosen as the primary evaluation metric due to its ability to account for both false positives and false negatives, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

## Challenges Faced

 - __Resource Constraints:__ Training transformer models like BERT requires significant computational resources. To address this, I utilized Kaggle's online lab, which provided the necessary GPU support.
   
 - __Fine-Tuning:__ Achieving optimal performance required extensive fine-tuning of hyperparameters such as the learning rate and batch size.

 - __Data Handling:__ Processing and tokenizing large datasets efficiently was a key challenge, especially ensuring that the input data was correctly formatted for BERT.

## Outcomes

The final model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.4%. This high level of accuracy was reflected in the F1 score on the validation set, demonstrating the model's robustness in distinguishing between clickbait and non-clickbait headlines.

## Community Contribution
The well-explained code was shared with the data science community, contributing to collective knowledge and fostering an environment of learning and collaboration.

## Quantifiable Success 
The model's performance surpassed initial expectations, showcasing a significant improvement over traditional machine-learning models.

 ## In Conclusion
The Clickbait Detection project not only honed my skills in NLP and transformer models but also provided a platform to apply these skills to a real-world problem. By addressing the challenge of clickbait detection, I developed a model that significantly improved content moderation on digital platforms. The successful implementation and high accuracy of the model underscore the potential of AI in solving complex problems in the digital content space.
